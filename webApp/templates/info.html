<h2>About NAPS</h2>
<p>
NAPS (NMR Assignments from Predicted Shifts) is a program for assigning NMR 
spectra using information from chemical shift predictions derived from protein 
structures. It is currently under development.
</p>
<p>
To use NAPS, you will need:
<ul>
    <li>a chemical shift list derived from one or more protein spectra. The shifts 
    should be grouped into spin systems/pseudo-residues. A number of formats are
    accepted, including SPARKY, XEASY, nmrPipe and shift lists exported from CCPN
    Analysis (v2.x). In future, it will be possible to import peaklists directly.</li>
    <li>a list of predicted chemical shifts. Currently, <a href="http://www.shiftx2.ca/">SHIFTX2</a> 
    and <a href="https://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/nmrserver/sparta/">SPARTA+</a> 
    predictions are accepted.</li>
</ul>
You can also leave both input fields blank, and the server will return results 
from some demonstration data.
</p>
<p>
After running NAPS, two pieces of information are returned:
<ul><
     <li>a table containing the maximum likelihood assignment.</li>
    <li>an interactive strip plot which allows you to quickly locate residues with 
    poor sequential links. (This will only be generated if your input data contains 
    sequential connectivity information for at least one carbon, eg. both CA_i and 
    CA_i-1 shifts.)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
NAPS is available at GitHub: you can find it at https://github.com/aheyam/NAPS. 
Any feedback would be gratefully received at alex.heyam at york.ac.uk.

<p>
NAPS is currently under development, and is available for demonstration or 
testing purposes only. It likely contains bugs, and may change without notice.
